<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

The first draft of a student effort to create an exact replica of the AirBnB website may be seen in this repository. In this phase, a backend console interface for managing program data is implemented. The user can control file storage, create, update, and destroy objects using console commands. Storage is durable across sessions thanks to a system of JSON serialization and deserialization.


See below steps:

1. First clone this repository.

2. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
3. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
4. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.
